# day2-demo


This repository created for my practice on Git & Github.


Things I did for making this ~~folder~~ repository.

+Created a empty repository named `day2-demo` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).

+Copied the contents for the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and link are

```
echo "# day2-demo" >> README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/nithyaveera/day2-demo.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explore and after open the cmd i just copy and paste and execute line one by one.
  
  +This first line`echo "# day2-demo" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `# day2-demo`
